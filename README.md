# INSPIRE PID Management System

The implementation of persistent identifiers for spatial objects is one of the most immediate challenges in the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive.

This project collects the work done to build a framework for resolvable persistent identifiers for INSPIRE resources in Spain. This work can be extended to other Member States.

The provided solution is able to register HTTP URI as persistent identifiers of INSPIRE spatial objects and resolve that HTTP URI into queries to INSPIRE download services.
